# Landing-Page
I create the directory of the new project of Odin 
I create the first section of the page of the project and style it.
After I done the header section I start the section1 and design it
I complate the section2 and section3 also the footer in the same way by writting html code and the style it by css one by one.
I used div to divide boxes in every section to make controlling easier.
